<div class="textblock"><p>This example demonstrates a very simple application where an energy deposit is accounted in user actions and their associated objects and a dose in a selected volume is calculated.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="B1_s1"></a>
GEOMETRY DEFINITION</h1>
<p>The geometry is constructed in the B1DetectorConstruction class. The setup consists of a an envelope of box shape containing two volumes: a spherical cone and a trapezoid.</p>
<p>In this example we use some common materials materials for medical applications. The envelope is made of water and the two inner volumes are made from tissue and bone materials. <br  />
 The materials are created with the help of the G4NistManager class, which allows to build a material from the NIST database using their names. Available materials and their compositions can be found in <a href="http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides
                                    /ForApplicationDeveloper/html/apas10.html">the Geant4 User's Guide for Application Developers, Appendix 10: Geant4 Materials Database </a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="B1_s2"></a>
PHYSICS LIST</h1>
<p>The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available in this example are set in the QBBC physics list. This physics list requires data files for electromagnetic and hadronic processes. See more on installation of the datasets in <a href="http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides
                                         /InstallationGuide/html/ch03s03.html">Geant4 Installation Guide, Chapter 3.3: Note On Geant4 Datasets </a>. The following datasets: G4LEDATA, G4LEVELGAMMADATA, G4NEUTRONXSDATA, G4SAIDXSDATA and G4ENSDFSTATEDATA are mandatory for this example.</p>
<p>In addition the build-in interactive command: </p><pre class="fragment">/process/(in)activate processName
</pre><p> allows to activate/inactivate the processes one by one.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="B1_s3"></a>
ACTION INITALIZATION</h1>
<p>A newly introduced class, B1ActionInitialization, instantiates and registers to Geant4 kernel all user action classes.</p>
<p>While in sequential mode the action classes are instatiated just once, via invoking the method: B1ActionInitialization::Build() in multi-threading mode the same method is invoked for each thread worker and so all user action classes are defined thread-local.</p>
<p>A run action class is instantiated both thread-local and global that's why its instance is created also in the method B1ActionInitialization::BuildForMaster() which is invoked only in multi-threading mode.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="B1_s4"></a>
PRIMARY GENERATOR</h1>
<p>The primary generator is defined in the B1PrimaryGeneratorAction class. The default kinematics is a 6 MeV gamma, randomly distributed in front of the envelope across 80% of the transverse (X,Y) envelope size. This default setting can be changed via the Geant4 built-in commands of the G4ParticleGun class.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="B1_s5"></a>
DETECTOR RESPONSE</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates a simple scoring implemented directly in the user action classes. Alternative ways of scoring via Geant4 classes can be found in the other examples.</p>
<p>The energy deposited is collected step by step for a selected volume in B1SteppingAction and accumulated event by event in B1EventAction.</p>
<p>At end of event, the value acummulated in B1EventAction is added in B1RunAction and summed over the whole run (see B1EventAction::EndOfevent()).</p>
<p>Total dose deposited is computed at B1RunAction::EndOfRunAction(), and printed together with informations about the primary particle. In multi-threading mode the energy accumulated in G4Accumulable objects per workers is merged to the master in B1RunAction::EndOfRunAction() and the final result is printed on the screen.</p>
<p>G4Accumulable&lt;G4double&gt; type instead of G4double type is used for the B1RunAction data members in order to facilitate merging of the values accumulated on workers to the master. Currently the accumulables have to be registered to G4AccumulablesManager and G4AccumulablesManager::Merge() has to be called from the users code. This is planned to be further simplified with a closer integration of G4Accumulable classes in the Geant4 kernel next year.</p>
<p>An example of creating and computing new units (e.g., dose) is also shown in the class constructor.</p>
<hr  />
<p>The following paragraphs are common to all basic examples</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="B1_A"></a>
VISUALISATION</h1>
<p>The visualization manager is set via the G4VisExecutive class in the main() function in exampleB1.cc. <br  />
 The initialisation of the drawing is done via a set of /vis/ commands in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from the main function when the example is used in interactive running mode.</p>
<p>By default, vis.mac opens an OpenGL viewer (/vis/open OGL). The user can change the initial viewer by commenting out this line and instead uncommenting one of the other /vis/open statements, such as HepRepFile or DAWNFILE (which produce files that can be viewed with the HepRApp and DAWN viewers, respectively). Note that one can always open new viewers at any time from the command line. For example, if you already have a view in, say, an OpenGL window with a name "viewer-0", then </p><pre class="fragment">/vis/open DAWNFILE
</pre><p> then to get the same view </p><pre class="fragment">/vis/viewer/copyView viewer-0
</pre><p> or to get the same view <em>plus</em> scene-modifications </p><pre class="fragment">/vis/viewer/set/all viewer-0
</pre><p> then to see the result </p><pre class="fragment">/vis/viewer/flush
</pre><p>The DAWNFILE, HepRepFile drivers are always available (since they require no external libraries), but the OGL driver requires that the Geant4 libraries have been built with the OpenGL option.</p>
<p>From Release 9.6 the vis.mac macro in example B1 has additional commands that demonstrate additional functionality of the vis system, such as displaying text, axes, scales, date, logo and shows how to change viewpoint and style. Consider copying these to other examples or your application. To see even more commands use help or ls or browse the available UI commands in the Application Developers Guide, Section 7.1.</p>
<p>For more information on visualization, including information on how to install and run DAWN, OpenGL and HepRApp, see the visualization tutorials, for example,<br  />

</ul>
<p>The tracks are automatically drawn at the end of each event, accumulated for all events and erased at the beginning of the next run.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="B1_B"></a>
USER INTERFACES</h1>
<p>The user command interface is set via the G4UIExecutive class in the main() function in exampleB1.cc The selection of the user command interface is then done automatically according to the Geant4 configuration or it can be done explicitly via the third argument of the G4UIExecutive constructor (see exampleB4a.cc).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="B1_C"></a>
HOW TO RUN</h1>
<ul>

and type in the commands from run1.mac line by line:

Idle&gt; exit
</pre> or <pre class="fragment">Idle&gt; /control/execute run1.mac

Idle&gt; exit
</pre></li>
<li>Execute exampleB1 in the 'batch' mode from macro files (without visualization) <pre class="fragment">% exampleB1 run2.mac
